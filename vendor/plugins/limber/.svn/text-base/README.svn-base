Generates an Adobe Flex application (Rich Internet Application) based on your
Rails app.  The application tree will appear under app/flex.  This plugin
also provides the rake tasks to regenerate, build and install the compiled Flex app.

CREDIT: The layout and structure of the generated application is based on the 
examples provided in the book, Flexible Rails by Peter Armstrong. (http://www.manning.com/armstrong/)
