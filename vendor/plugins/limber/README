Limber
======

Generates an Adobe Flex application (Rich Internet Application) based on your
Rails app.  The application tree will appear under app/flex.  This plugin
also provides the rake tasks to regenerate, build and install the compiled Flex app.

CREDIT: The layout and structure of the generated application is based loosely on the 
examples provided in the book, Flexible Rails by Peter Armstrong. (http://www.manning.com/armstrong/)  Significant differences are due to the nature
of the application for which this plugin was originally developed.

Buy the book to learn more about how Flex works with Rails.


Example
=======

	The command:

    ./script/generate flex_application

	provides usage instructions.  For additional information, see the (not yet existing)
	api documentation.
