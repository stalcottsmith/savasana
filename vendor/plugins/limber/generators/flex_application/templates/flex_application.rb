  # The :to_mxml method is where the magic happens.
  #  - Limber invokes this method to generate the MXML.
  #  - Rubyâ€™s block structure is used to indicate XML containment hierarchy.
  #  - Unrecognized methods are assumed to correspond to ActionScript classes.
  #  - Hash parameters turn into XML attributes.
  #  - Many shortcuts have been implemented to make attributes more readable
  #    and to reduce code size.  Documentation forthcoming...
