Usage: script/generate flex_application [app_name] [model1, model2, ...]

Description:
    Generates the source for an Adobe Flex application 
    (Rich Internet Application) based on your Rails app.

    The Limber plugin also provides the rake tasks to regenerate,
    build and install the compiled Flex app.
    
    CREDIT: The layout and structure of the generated application
    is based on the examples provided in the book, Flexible Rails,
    by Peter Armstrong. (http://www.manning.com/armstrong/)

Example:

    Firstly, the command:  
    (note the absence of model specifications, see below)

      ./script/generate flex_application MyFirstFlexApp

    will create:
      app/flex
      app/flex/com
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/assets
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/business
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/command
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/components
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/control
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/model
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/util
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/util/CairngormUtils.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/util/DebugMessage.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/util/ServiceUtils.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/util/XMLUtils.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/validators
      app/flex/my_first_flex_app.rb
      app/flex/lib
      app/flex/lib/Cairngorm.swc
      public/MyFirstFlexApp.html

    Once this is done, if you did not include any models when you
    generated the initial flex layout, you may generate your Flex
    models corresponding to the Rails models you want your Flex app
    to use.  Without parameters, it will generate code for every
    model in your Rails app.  Skip to the end to learn how to do all
    the following in a single step.

    The command:

      rake limber:generate_models task

    will create:
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/business/TaskDelegate.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/command/CreateTaskCommand.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/command/DestroyTaskCommand.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/command/ListTasksCommand.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/command/UpdateTasksCommand.as
      app/flex/com/my_first_flex_app/model/Task.as
    
    At this point you will want to edit app/flex/my_first_flex_app.rb 
    to make    your application gui do something useful with these models.
    See the Limber API documentation for further information.  Once this
    is done, proceed with building your app.
    
    The command:
    
      rake limber:generate_app my_first_flex_app
    
    will create: (and possibly other files)
    
      app/flex/MyFirstFlexApp.mxml
    
    The command:
    
      rake limber:compile my_first_flex_app
    
    will run the Adobe Flex compiler on your application and 
    will create:
    
      app/flex/MyFirstFlexApp.swf
    
    Now your app is compiled!  Install it.  The command:
    
      rake limber:install my_first_flex_app
    
    which will copy it into the public directory where browsers
    can find it.
    
    
    And if you found all the rake tasks tedious, and you have 
    a useful my_first_flex_app.rb already built, you may do the
    entire procedure in one step.
    
    The command:
    
      rake limber:flex my_first_flex_app
    
    will do the whole thing.
